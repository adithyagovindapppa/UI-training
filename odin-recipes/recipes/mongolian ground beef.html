	<h1>Mongolian Ground Beef</h1>
    <img src="/odin-recipes/recipes/mongolian ground beef (1).jpeg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Typically Mongolian beef is made with thin slices of steak (like flank steak). It has a mild and sweet flavor that is completely addictive! Today we’re taking the concept of Mongolian Beef and simplifying it with ground beef instead of steak. We’ve also simplified the sauce and kept overall ingredients to a minimum (in true “back-to-school life-saver” form).

        What we aren’t skimping on, though, is flavor! This Mongolian Ground Beef is mega flavorful with a slightly sweet flavor and nice mild crunch from the green onions. And even though we’re packing in the flavor, we’re still keeping everything totally kid-friendly. This ground beef dish is more on the sweet, rather than the spicy side. If you would like some more spice, it’s very easy to adjust to personal preference.

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li> Lean ground beef.2 tsp minced ginger,3 cloves garlic,1/2 cup low sodium soy sauce,1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
      </ul>  
     <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li> We like a 93/7 blend of ground beef. A higher fat percentage will work fine; you’ll just want to drain off the excess grease before adding in the sauce. We’ve also tested this recipe with lean (93/7) ground turkey and loved it!</li>
        <li>Combine the soy sauce, brown sugar and hoisin sauce in a small dish and pour into ground beef mixture. Cook for about 2 to 3 minutes to blend flavors. Meanwhile in a small dish combine the 1/4 cup water along with the 2 tbsp cornstarch. Pour the mixture into the ground beef and stir until sauce thickens.</li>
        <li>Season with red pepper flakes, black pepper and green onions. Serve hot over hot rice or noodles. Enjoy!</li>
        <li>Add the white wine to the pan. Open the cans of clams and squeeze out the clam juice from the cans into the pan as well.</li>

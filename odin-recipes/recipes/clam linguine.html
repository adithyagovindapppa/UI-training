	<h1>Clam linguniue</h1>
    <img src="/odin-recipes/recipes/clam linguine.jpeg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Once they’re cleaned, the clams will only take a few minutes to steam with the white wine and aromatics. Littlenecks will take 5-8 minutes, and Manila clams just 3-5 minutes.
        For the best Linguine with Clams, keep an eye on the clams to make sure they don’t overcook.  Fresh clams are the the star of the show here, and they’ll toughen quickly if cooked for too long. They’re ready when their shells have opened.

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>salted butter,8 ounces spaghett,3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil,1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
      </ul>  
     <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li> I like to use a nice Sauvignon Blanc or dry Pinot Grigio in this recipe. You don’t have to go crazy on the price point, but choose a wine that you’d be happy to drink. (Both for the quality of the sauce and since you won’t use the whole bottle in the recipe.).</li>
         <li> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil (1 tablespoon of salt for every 2 quarts of water). While the water is heating, prep the garlic, lemon zest, and parsley.  </li>
       <li>Add the spaghetti to the boiling water, set your timer for 2 minutes less than the recommended time (so you can be assured that you are cooking the pasta al dente).</li>
       <li>Heat 3 Tbsp of olive oil in a sauté pan on medium heat. Add the minced garlic and the red chili pepper flakes. Cook for 30 seconds to a minute, until the garlic just is on the edge of browning.</li>
      </ol>
